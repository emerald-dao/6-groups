## 🚩 Challenge 6: Groups

🎫 Deploy a subcommunities contract to learn the basics of voting inside of a DAO on the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:
- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts. 
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Next.js app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

🌟 The final deliverable is a DApp that allows users to create Groups, join & leave them, discover Groups, and chat inside of them.
